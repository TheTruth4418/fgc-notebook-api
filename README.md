Welcome to my FGC Notebook application!

Synopsis:
- This is a notebook style application for keeping notes on your favorite fighting games.
- Have access to these before playing at a big tournament or just to freshen up in general!

Requirements/Installation:
In order to ensure the app runs on your computer you need to ensure the following:
- Install Node and npm
- When Node and npm is installed, assuming everything is forked right you should be able to get up and running!

Using the API:

- Home Screen
From here you can select between the Create or Viewing modes!

- Create
Arriving at the create page give you two buttons that say Character Note or Matchup Note. A character note will be something specific to a character while a matchup will be a note you want to take when going against a certain fighter with your selected fighter! After the creation, you will either recieve a success message upon creation, or an error message upon error.


- Viewing
Assuming that there are notes created, this is where they are viewed! Follow the prompts to navigate yourself to the destination and using the form, view your creations!

- Bullet Points and Deletions.
Like in school everyones notes has bullet points! With every note created, you are able to have bullet points for little side notes you want to make on a main point! Deleting a note is useful for when you dont  need it anymore so that way it isnt in your way!
