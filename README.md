Welcome to my FGC Notebook application!

-Starting up
The home screen will guide you to select between Creation mode and the Viewing mode.

-Creation
Creation mode is where all the notes are created at. Upon clicking this mode, A form will appear in which you can select a game and then the corresponding characters will then update on the drop down menus. Upon creation there will be a success message.

-Viewing
Viewing mode is where you view your notes that you creaated in creation! You select the type of notes between character and matchup, then select your character(s) and the notes will appear! Here you can also add bullet points to your created notes as well.
